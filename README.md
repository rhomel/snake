# Basic Snake Game implemented with Ebiten

Run the game: `go run cmd/snake.go`

Build a MacOS .app: `make build-macos-app`. Open it with `open snake.app` or
double click the icon in Finder.

Requires Go and a C compiler because Ebiten needs a C compiler.

## Controls

Use the arrow keys or standard WASD keys to change direction.

Press `escape` at any point to exit the game.

After the game ends, press `space` to restart.
